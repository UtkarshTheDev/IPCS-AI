## 🎯 What is CSIP AI?

CSIP AI is being developed as a comprehensive, **offline-first** AI assistant that will help students:
- Build CS/IP projects independently without copying code
- Learn programming concepts through interactive guidance
- Generate complete project solutions with explanations
- Debug code and understand errors in simple language

**Key Advantage:** Everything runs locally on your computer - no internet required, no data shared online!

## 🚀 Planned Features

### 💬 **Chat Mode** *(Coming Soon)*
- Terminal-based AI assistant (like ChatGPT, but offline!)
- Get instant help with programming concepts
- Ask for project ideas, debugging help, or code explanations
- Example: *"Suggest file handling project ideas for my CS practical"*

### 🤖 **Agent Mode** *(Coming Soon)*
- Describe your project idea and let AI build it for you
- Automatic code generation with proper structure and comments
- Complete project creation from simple descriptions
- Example: *"Create a library management system with book search and issue tracking"*

### 📚 **Learn Mode** *(Coming Soon)*
- Step-by-step interactive learning experience
- Small coding tasks that build up to complete projects
- Real-time feedback and hints system
- Progressive difficulty levels for skill building
