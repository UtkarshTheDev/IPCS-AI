# 🤖 IPCS AI – The Offline AI CLI Assistant for Class 11 CS/IP Projects

IPCS AI is a local, offline AI tool made using Python — designed for 11th-grade students to help them build IPCS projects, learn programming step-by-step, and get ideas or full project generation using a smart AI CLI.

> ⚠️ All code has been written **strictly inside school hours only**. No internet, no home coding, no online tools involved.

## 🚀 Modes in IPCS AI

### 🗨️ 1. Chat Mode
- Like ChatGPT, but inside your terminal.
- Ask queries, get ideas, debug code, or clarify logic.
- Example: _“Suggest 3 file handling project ideas with real-life use.”_

### ⚙️ 2. Agent Mode
- Just describe your project idea and the AI will build the whole thing for you.
- You don’t have to manually write each line — the agent takes care of logic, structure, and syntax.
- Example: _“Make a student marks management system with sorting and search.”_

### 📘 3. Learn Mode
- Designed to help you **learn by doing**.
- You build widgets through **very small coding tasks**.
- Each task is checked step-by-step:
  - ✅ Press Tick to check your solution.
  - 🧠 Ask for hints or feedback.
  - ➕ Ask for the next task.
  - Great for learning logic, syntax, and structure one step at a time.


## 🧠 Why Use IPCS AI?

 - Helps you **build IPCS projects without copying**.
 - Teaches logic in **simple, class-level language**.
 - Promotes **independent thinking** with smart feedback.
  - Works completely **offline**.
  - Keeps your files safe and stored locally.
  - Encourages **project-based learning** inside school.
